        <br><br><h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
        <p>Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency that can be transferred in the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. 
            the idea being that the ledger is truly decentralised, being owned by no one and 
            needing a community consensus to be accepted as the ‘true’ blockchain.
            Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and 
            recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.</p>
        
        <h2>How do we calculate the Bitcoin transaction?</h2>
        <p> We calculate the transaction using queueing model/Theory. Queueing Theory is the studying of service systems that need to capture customer arrivals, service time, and
            the number of servers in the system and how much each of these factors affect the time it takes for a customer to enter and exit the system. Queueing models are designed to be investigative, 
            to be able to identify bottlenecks in a system, and forecast the ways in which potential improvements to one or a few specific areas could impact the other areas. 
        These models can come in many different forms and are often defined using Kendall’s notation.<h2>What is the objectives of this simulation app? </h2>
        <p>The objectives of this project is to create a mathematical representation of the Bitcoin transaction confirmation process. 
            The queueing model will be used to investigate the relationship between the expected confirmation time of a transaction and 
            the other variables within the model, such as the arrival rate, service rate, fee rate, and more.
        <br> Specifically, the objectives of this project include:
        <br>•	Design and develop a model to simulate the bitcoin transactions' arrival and confirmation process based on queueing Theory   
        <br>•	Predict the waiting time of transactions under various traffic conditions and fee rates, using real-life bitcoin data (e.g., transaction fees) as input 
        <br>•	Use the output data from the model to analyse the relationship between the transaction confirmation time and other transaction factors such as the fees, mempool traffic conditions, or arrival rate. 
        <br>•	Help bitcoin traders to decide on the transaction fees to offer to achieve individually expected waiting time considering the changing traffic conditions.   
            </p>
        <h2>what is the goal of the app?</h2>
        <p>The scope of this project is limited to creating a conceptual, exploratory model for analytical use by the team and 
            then delivering some key findings using this model. This project is not aiming to deliver a software prototype, 
            nor is it taking into consideration the usability (e.g. user-friendliness, user experience, etc.)</p>
